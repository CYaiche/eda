## Introduction 🌱

As my first project for my Machine Learning diploma, **FromPlateToHeart** signifies my commitment to utilizing data science to empower individuals with heart-healthy dietary recommendations. Leveraging the Open Food Facts dataset, I've created an application that delivers personalized suggestions aligned with cardiovascular wellness.

## Data Cleanup Notebook 🧹

In this notebook, I meticulously prepared the Open Food Facts dataset for analysis:

- **First Filtering of Interest**: Focused on products with names and sold in France 🇫🇷.
- **Missing Values Thresholds**: Managed missing values with defined thresholds.
- **Aberrant Value Handling**: Addressed aberrant values effectively.
- **Atypical Values Handling**: Employed the interquartile range technique to enhanced data integrity.

## Exploratory Analysis Notebook 🔍

This notebook dwells on :

- **Univariate Analysis**: Explored nutrition score and grade distributions.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Examined fat content vs. nutrition grade.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Explored complex interactions for informed insights.
- **Application Output**: Applied findings to enhance the recommendation engine.
